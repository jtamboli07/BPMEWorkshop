# Build an Organization Project
Organizational Models are normally created for specific solutions in organizations. This is a best practice not to share Org Models as having project share could impact systems if an org model needs to change for a different project. Let's create a new Org Model.

1) Select File > New > Organization Project

2) Name the project and hit finish.

<img src="/images/organization/2.jpg" alt="create organization project" width=700/>

3) In the loaded page, drag "Organization Unit" from the palette and name it "Dispute Team"

<img src="/images/organization/3.png" alt="create organization project" width=700/>

4) Add 3 postions

and name them as ***a)CustomerService b)DisputeAdvisor c)FraudInvestigator***

6) Also name the page as "MyDisputeOrg" and save the project.

### Congratulations Your Org Model is completed

When the case is created there are 2 ways you can interact with it. 
1. Case Action: Through a case action you can interact with the case on an ad-hoc basis. That means a user can view the data and updater the data but is not forced by an SLA to do so. Activities like an address change is a good example of this kind of interaction.
2. Process Instance: Process instances are used when you want to make sure works gets done in a timely fashion. It is possible to put a deadline/SLA on a user tasks which means that the process can notify someone of it is not completed in a predefined time. The process also monitors the activities and can report on them.

Lets start by creating a Case Action.
