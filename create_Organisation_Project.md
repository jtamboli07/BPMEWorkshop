# Build an Organization Project
Organizational Models are generally created for specific process solutions in organizations. A best practice is not to share Org Models. Sharing projects could impact systems if an org model needs to change for a different project. Let's create a new Org Model.

1) Select File > New > Organization Project

2) Name the project and hit finish.

3) In the loaded page, drag "Organization Unit" from the palette and name it "Dispute Team."

4) Add three positions

and name them as ***a)CustomerService b)DisputeAdvisor c)FraudInvestigator***

6) Also, name the page as "MyDisputeOrg" and save the project.

### Congratulations Your Org Model is completed

After case creation, there are two ways you can interact with it. 
1. Case Action: Through a case action, you can interact with the case on an ad-hoc basis. In other words, a user can view or update the data. No SLA forces the user to complete an action. Activities like an address change are an excellent example of this kind of interaction.
2. Process Instance: Process instances ensure works gets done in a timely fashion. SLA's/Deadline Events monitor the time allotted to complete activities. It is possible to put a deadline/SLA on a user's tasks which means that the process can notify someone if not completed in a predefined time. The process also monitors the activities and can report on them.

Let's start by creating a Case Action.
