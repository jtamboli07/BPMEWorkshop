# Organizational Models (_org)
When creating a BPM project, you will require an organizational model for offering and allocating tasks to people in the organization. It is recommended that a new organizational model is used for every project you implement. This is because it makes it easier to life cycle the artifact with the project it was intended for. It makes troubleshooting easier when problems are occurring.
