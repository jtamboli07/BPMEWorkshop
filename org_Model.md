# Organizational Models (_org)
When creating a BPM project you will require a organizational model for offering and allocating tasks to people in the organization. It is recommended that a new organizational model is used for every project you implement. The reason for this is that it makes it easier to life cycle the artifact with the project it was intended for. This makes trouble shooting easier when problems are occur.
